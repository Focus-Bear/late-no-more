# Motivation from jeznag

I built Late No More because being late for meetings was becoming very problematic for me (I got fired from a job because of it). I have ADHD and it‚Äôs way too easy for me to see a notification for a calendar appointment, space out and then forget about the meeting for five minutes. Sometimes I hit Dismiss instead of Snooze and never show up to the meeting at all.

My experience is that most calendar apps aren‚Äôt built for an ADHD brain like mine. I decided to build a Mac app that would help me and hopefully other people show up on time.

Late-No-More gives you notifications that make sense.

A notification 15 minutes before to remind you to prepare: this one is easy to dismiss
A notification 2 minutes before to remind you to actually join the dang meeting - this one is not easy to dismiss
‚Äç
As the time gets closer to the meeting, the notification gets more and more obnoxious. It changes colour and starts playing annoying motivating sound effects. The goal is to get you to join the meeting 2 minutes early.

Once you‚Äôre in the meeting, the app asks you to set an intention - what do you want to learn/share during this meeting?

I‚Äôve gotta admit that not only am I frequently late for meetings, I‚Äôm also frequently multitasking/distracting. Reflecting on it, what‚Äôs the point of showing up for the meeting if I‚Äôm not going to be there mentally as well? I‚Äôve started declining invites to irrelevant meetings with 50 people in them. If the purpose of the meeting is for me to absorb information, I‚Äôd rather listen back to the recording at 2x speed.

‚ÄçFor the meetings that I do choose to attend, I want to give them my full attention: camera on, no other apps, listening intently. That‚Äôs really hard for my brain but it‚Äôs not impossible. It starts with aligning my motivation: why do I want to show up for the meeting? Hopefully it‚Äôs an engaging meeting. If not, that‚Äôs ok - I can treat it as an opportunity to train my focus muscle and use the tactics that work for me - clearing distractions from my desk, taking notes and sometimes playing with a fidget toy if I need to (‚ÄúBusy hands, quiet mind‚Äù right?).

## Architecture

The calendar alerting is done via a Node JS script that uses applescript + CalendarLib EC. 

The settings UI is a swift app.

## Local development of Node JS app

Clone this repo and run:

`npm install`

Then you need to install CalendarLib EC (https://latenightsw.com/freeware/)

```
mkdir -p ~/Library/Script\ Libraries
cp swift-app/pkg/files/Library/Script\ Libraries/CalendarLib\ EC.scptd ~/Library/Script\ Libraries/CalendarLib\ EC.scptd
```

Then you can start the node app

`npm run start`

or for testing

`npm run test`

## How it works

There are two core cycles in play:

1. First is to check iCal and save all meetings occurring in the next specified minutes to a local, in-memory list. This is governed by checkCalendarFrequencyMinutes.
2. Second is to check the upcomingEvents, in-memory list for any imminent meetings and notify. This is governed by checkUpcomingFrequencySeconds.
3. Upon meetings, optionally set an intention & write notes, which are saved to ~/Documents/LateNoMore-Meetings.csv.
