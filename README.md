# Late No More

Checks local iCal via AppleScript & notifies about upcoming events and meetings. This repo is for a piece of subfunctionality for the Late No More desktop app. To learn more, visit the Focus Bear website.

## Setup

Clone this repo and run:

`npm install`

Then

`npm run start`

or for testing

`npm run test`

## How it works

There are two core cycles in play:

1. First is to check iCal and save all meetings occurring in the next specified minutes to a local, in-memory list. This is governed by checkCalendarFrequencyMinutes.
2. Second is to check the upcomingEvents, in-memory list for any imminent meetings and notify. This is governed by checkUpcomingFrequencySeconds.
3. Upon meetings, optionally set an intention & write notes, which are saved to ~/Documents/LateNoMore-Meetings.csv.
